[Khichdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi_(dish)) (pronounced /kich â€¢ dee/) refers to a South Asian dish made with rice and lentils, widely eaten as a comfort food. It is a wonderful, aromatic blend of simple ingredients.

Khichdi is a functional language which supports:
- Mutable variables (by-reference and by-value)
- Mutable boxes
- First-class (recursive) functions
- Arrays, dictionaries and pairs
- Backstops (akin to [Scala Implicits](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi1m4KSzMeEAxVXIjQIHcvFDZUQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.scala-lang.org%2Ftour%2Fimplicit-parameters.html&usg=AOvVaw0YCR6w7GTXGLMYnGvj6ZZ-&opi=89978449))
- Generalized search
- Exceptions
- Continuations

This is my attempt of putting together most of the ideas I learned in CPSC 311: Definition of Programming Languages (hence the name). You can read more about the development of this project at my [blog](https://kumarpit.github.io/posts/khichdi/).
